# Statistics

## WakaTime Statistics for calculating averages

This project was created to calculate the averages for a given user

## Dependencies

	rauth - Authentication

## Notes from the Developer

You will need to create the file called `codes.json` which will hold your client_id, secret, and api_key. The folder called `data` will hold the data from each month. These files will be generated and pulled by `auth.py`, which `parse.py` will parse them and return the statistics.
